      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        There is a lot that goes into healthcare; not the least of which is the
        patients attitude towards their own care. A lot negative outcomes can be
        avoided if there is a more clear understanding of how the healthcare
        process works, with regards to <i>both</i> the healthcare provider and
        the patient.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to solve this gap in understanding, Smart Patient Academy aims
        to increase the level of engagment from all parties involved, and
        provide a tangible metric for how engaged you might be. This score would
        help both parties reflect on how they might improve their healthcare
        experience. Through the Smart Patient Academy book, you learn multiple
        examples of how the system is not neccessarily designed to benefit
        patients. You also learn what to do about it. That, in conjunction with
        the Smart Patient Academy Patient Identity Profile will help you move
        through the steps to become a more empowered patient.
