      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Developers enjoy coding. Testing and monitoring their apps is tedious
        and boring and often left too late in the lifecycle. Further, existing
        IBM monitoring tools had a steep learning curve and focused on
        data-dumping and letting users figure things out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Focusing on synthetic monitoring, the simulation of end-users going
        through an interface, we built a cloud service that allowed users to
        test their apps, web pages and APIs from different geolocations with no
        setup.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the research process it became clear that users wanted a
        quick overview of existing problems while pointing them in the right
        direction. Our goal was to answer the question: is there anything wrong
        and what do I need to do about it? Hence, we established a clear
        hierarchy to provide crucial data at first glance and more information
        at the users request.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our design was a hierarchical concept, inspired by TV's
        picture-in-picture concept (if you're old enough) allowed users to
        compare the performance across metrics while maintaining focus on
        primary data. Below, a view of all application tests and downtime
        metrics.
