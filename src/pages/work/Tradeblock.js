          <h3>Challenge</h3>
          <p>How might we build a trusted market for the trade of sneakers</p>
          <h4>Context</h4>
          <p>
            Sneaker heads are a passionate, discerning and loyal group of collectors with a tremendous amount of market influence. So much so that they have developed entire markets of bartering and trade for their most coveted pocessions -- their shoes. These markets are largely ad-hoc, existing at popups, conventions or through social media messages. However, with no dedicated platform, this leaves the buyers and sellers at a high risk for fraud. Our goal, was to design and build a platform where sneaker heads could do their bartering and trading in a controlled and trusted manner, mitigating the risk for fake shoes and bogus wire transfers.

            Platforms exist for the purchase of used shoes - where collectors can send their shoes to be validated by a 3rd party and then sold on their behalf. However this is not the way that these collectors work. They are typically going shoe for shoe. My Union LA x Air Jordan 4 Retro 'Guava Ice' (size 10) for your Air Jordan 4 Retro 'Purple Metallic' (size 10.5). This skips the middle step, and provides a lot more potential upside for the collectors.
