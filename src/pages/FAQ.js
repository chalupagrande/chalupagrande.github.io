      <h4>Why chalupagrande?</h4>
      <p>
        It is a running joke with my dad. Just about everytime I talk to him he
        has a different nickname for me. The one I like the most is Chalupa
        Grande.

      <h4>Something is broken. Why don't you fix it (updated 6/17/21)</h4>
      <p>
        I think we can both tell that this website is largely a joke. I don't
        want to spend more time on it than is absolutely necessary. It was also
        originally built like 3 years ago, and then refactored to be less
        annoyingly minimalist 2 years ago... and you know what i dont need to
        explain myself. I'll get to it eventually.

      <h4>
        Why does this site look so dumb if you're so good at all this stuff?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Why spend more time on self promotion than necessary? Plus. I can spend
        more time on your project! And also other more fun things.

      <h4>What sort of art do you do?</h4>
      <p>
        Mostly mural arts. But I am in the process of combining my propensity
        for technology with my love of visual arts. More to come! If you want to
        see an Augmented Reality Project I did, watch{' '}
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtpZDYSYy5s">
          this short documentary about it
        </a>
        . It's goofy.

      <h4>What the hell is a chalupa?</h4>
      <p>
        Okay, so this one is kinda annoying. if you{' '}
        <a href="https://lmgtfy.com/?q=chalupa+images">
          Google Image search Chalupa
        </a>
        , you get a bunch of images that look like fried tacos... but here is
        the thing. Growing up I always order Chalupas (from legit Tex-Mex
        restraunts in South Central Texas) and I would receive a FLAT looking
        taco. Basically, a hard shell with a bunch of meat and veggies on it.
        Anyway, they're delicious and now I'm hungry and going to go make lunch.
        This website is over-the-top enough anyway.
