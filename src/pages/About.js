        I know this site looks simple, and is completely unstyled, and yes. it
        is simple and completely unstyled. But don't let that fool you, I am a
        full stack developer and I pride myself on being able to build just
        about anything I set my mind to. I have worked on many projects and with
        many technologies that would make this site look like a petting zoo.
        (I'm not sure why I went with that analogy but... <Emoji symbol="ðŸ¤·" />
        ). Here are just a few:

      <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <h4>Why chalupagrande?</h4>
      <p>
        It is a running joke with my dad. Just about everytime I talk to him he
        has a different nickname for me. The one I like the most is Chalupa
        Grande.
      </p>
      <h4>Something is broken. Why don't you fix it (updated 6/17/21)</h4>
      <p>
        I think we can both tell that this website is largely a joke. I don't
        want to spend more time on it than is absolutely necessary. It was also
        originally built like 3 years ago, and then refactored to be less
        annoyingly minimalist 2 years ago... and you know what i dont need to
        explain myself. I'll get to it eventually.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Why does this site look so dumb if you're so good at all this stuff?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Why spend more time on self promotion than necessary? Plus. I can spend
        more time on your project! And also other more fun things.
      </p>

      <h4>What web technologies are you familiar with?</h4>
      <p>
        javascript, html5, css3, babel, webpack, gulp, react, redux, carbon
        components, vue, nextjs, git, mongoDB, neo4j,cypher, stripe, twilio,
        apollo, grapql, tensorflowjs, lerna, node, express, mongoose, eslint,
        prettier, jest, threejs, passport, antd design system, scss, yarn,
        docker, kubernetes, d3, p5 <br /> and ... idk.... probably some others
        too.{' '}
      </p>

      <h4>Are you available to work on my project?</h4>
      <p>
        Dunno! Shoot me an email using the{' '}
        <a href="https://etcetera.cr">contact</a> form and I'll get back to you
        as soon as I can!
      </p>

      <h4>What sort of art do you do?</h4>
      <p>
        Mostly mural arts. But I am in the process of combining my propensity
        for technology with my love of visual arts. More to come! If you want to
        see an Augmented Reality Project I did, watch{' '}
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtpZDYSYy5s">
          this short documentary about it
        </a>
        . It's goofy.
      </p>

      <h4>What the hell is a chalupa?</h4>
      <p>
        Okay, so this one is kinda annoying. if you{' '}
        <a href="https://lmgtfy.com/?q=chalupa+images">
          Google Image search Chalupa
        </a>
        , you get a bunch of images that look like fried tacos... but here is
        the thing. Growing up I always order Chalupas (from legit Tex-Mex
        restraunts in South Central Texas) and I would receive a FLAT looking
        taco. Basically, a hard shell with a bunch of meat and veggies on it.
        Anyway, they're delicious and now I'm hungry and going to go make lunch.
        This website is over-the-top enough anyway.
